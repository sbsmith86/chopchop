### Description
We need to set up a basic test suite for the repository to ensure the GitHub connection and OpenAI connection are working. This will help verify that the setup is functioning properly and can run directly from the GitHub Actions workflow.

### Tasks
1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/basic-tests.yml`).
2. Add a job to test the GitHub API connection by making a simple API call as part of the workflow.
3. Add a job to test the OpenAI API connection (e.g., by sending a minimal request and verifying the response).
4. Ensure the workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
5. Document any setup actions (e.g., creating API keys or adding them as secrets in GitHub).

### Setup Actions
- Add a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to the repository (GitHub provides this automatically for workflows).
- Add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret with your OpenAI API key.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A GitHub Actions workflow is created and running on the repository.
- [ ] The workflow successfully tests the GitHub API connection.
- [ ] The workflow successfully tests the OpenAI API connection.
- [ ] Documentation on setup actions is included in the repository (e.g., in the README or a separate file).
